  <Page text="Welcome to Beyond Beyaan!  This window will explain the various aspects of the game.  You can move it around if necessary.
        
        Navigate the tutorial using the controls provided below.  Press next page please." />
  <Page text="Here you see the galaxy setup screen.  This is where you set up the galaxy for the game.  Galaxy generation uses scripts that you can create or modify, they are found in Scripts/Galaxy directory of the dataset.  For now, leave all options as is and click on generate galaxy button." />
  <Page text="You should see a preview of the galaxy, and the number of stars under the preview.  The options below the preview are not functioning, so ignore them for now.  You may notice the Battle Simulator, but for now, ignore it, we will come back to it later.  Click on Players Setup please." />
  <Page text="This is where you set up the players for the game.  You can set the race, name, and whether or not that player is human controlled.  There are no AI scripts yet, so computer players will just sit there and do nothing.  For now, add one human and one computer players with settings of your choosings, then click on Start Game." />
  <Page text="You should see your home system selected, with the list of planets displayed on top.  One of those planet is your empire's color, click on that planet." />
  <Page text="There are five sliders.  Starting from top, they are Agriculture, Environment, Commerce, Research, and Production.  Agriculture feeds your people, and determines the population growth.  Environment keeps your planet clean, allow too much pollution and your planet will degrade to a worse terrain type.  Those two are automatically set each turn unless you have them locked.  Commerce generates BCs (Billion Credits), they are for maintainance of your ships and pays for espionage and security, among other items.  Research creates RPs (Research Points) that you can allocate to various research projects.  Production supplies your empire with PP (Production Points) where you can allocate to different construction projects." />
  <Page text="Under the sliders are the population data.  A planet can have more than one race on it, it will indicate which race have the highest amount.  As of now, there are no racial perks or disadvantages, they will be implemented later."/>
  <Page text="Now click outside the planet/system window to close them.  Click on your fleet icon near your home system.  The window shows a list of fleets at that location, and the first fleet are selected automatically.  You can see the ships in your fleet, however no ship information display are shown because they're not added yet.  Note the three buttons below the fleet list.  From left to right, they are:  Transfer population to transports, scrap selected ships, and clear orders.  As of now, only transfer button are functioning." />
  <Page text="To order your ships to move, highlight a location that you would like them to move to, then right click.  Note that the path may not be straight, this is a result of the background nebula, the more bright the nebula is, the slower your ships travel through them.  So it automatically calculate the quickest path.  To separate your fleet, unselect the ships that you want to leave behind by clicking on their button, then after you've unselected the ships, you right click on a location and it will split automatically.  To unselect all ships, click on the fleet's name, it will toggle selection." />
  <Page text="To explore a star, at least one ship must be adjacent to it.  Order at least one of your ship to a nearby star.  We will come back to this later." />
  <Page text="On bottom of the screen you see three things.  On left is the total reserves and income.  In the middle are the taskbar, there are buttons that you can use to navigate to different screens.  On right is the current turn.  You can hover over each button momentarily, and a description will pop up.  Please click on the ship design, it is the middle button." />
  <Page text="In the ship design screen, you see the design for a scout.  Let's make a simple fighter.  Click on Clear All, this will remove all the equipment.  Change the ship size by clicking on Lancer button, then pick Corvette.  Name the ship design whatever you want.  Now click on Add Equipments." />
  <Page text="Here you see a lot of buttons.  On the top is different types of equipment that you can add.  Right now, not all have technologies yet.  Let's add a FTL engine, this allows your ship to move around in the galaxy.  Click on the third button from right.  You should see Nuclear and Small Drive in the two drop-downs.  Left drop-down is the type of technology to use.  Right drop-down is the type of mounting to use.  The number on right is the amount.  You can make a speedy scout by adding multiple engines.  For now, one will do, click on add equipment." />
  <Page text="We need a different type of engine to move around in space combat (not quite implemented yet, only a simulator at this point).  Let's add one.  Open the add equipment window again, and select the fourth button from right, and click on Add Equipment.  Do the same for adding a laser cannon." />
  <Page text="Now that we have a basic fighter, click on confirm design.  It will add the design to your list of available designs, and clear the design for the next one.  Let's build the ship you just designed, click on Production List on the bottom row of buttons, it is the fourth button from right." />
  <Page text="This is list of projects that your empire are working on.  Right now, it's empty.  This can have terraforming, ship construction, ship refitting, and so forth.  Right now, only terraforming and ship construction are implemented.  Click on Add Project on bottom right of the screen." />
  <Page text="You can see the galaxy, with stars colored based on their ownership.  You can see your home system in the preview.  In top left is list of systems that you can host projects at.  Note the 5 next to an icon?  That is the system's production capacity.  Terraforming planets usually require at least 10, and you can see the different capacities required by different ship designs on right.  Select your new design, and note that on bottom is the production cost.  This is different from capacity.  It can be cheaper to build a massive tanker than a very sophisicated battle cruiser.  Click on Add this Project, then close the window by clicking exit." />
  <Page text="Note that it says Paused?  This is because your planet isn't generating production.  Let's explore a new screen, the planets management screen.  Click on Planet Management from the bottom row of buttons." />
  <Page text="Here you see several things.  The obvious one is the galaxy preview.  The bottom left is a list of filters.  Try turning them on and off, you should see the list of planets change.  If you hover over a planet in the list, it will highlight the system that contains that planet.  Now unselect Foreign Planets and Unowned Planets, and leave everything else selected.  The bottom right area should now light up.  This is a powerful tool, it allows you to set the outputs of the visible planets in the list.  For example, if you want all rich planets to focus their output on production, you can have Poor and Normal planets unselected, and it will have only rich planets in the list.  Now, drag the slider fully to the right for both Commerce and Production so that both shows 50%.  Then click Apply Percentages to Selected Planets.  Note that the empire output summary changed.  Go back to production screen." />
  <Page text="Depending on the cost of the ship, if it was the basic design, it should say 2 Per Turn now.  If you add more projects, you can divide up the total production by using the slider.  The number above slider is amount of PPs that will go into that project this turn.  Now let's take a look at research screen.  Click on the second rightmost button." />
  <Page text="On left is the six technology fields, and their current research topic.  On top right is list of researched technologies.  Bottom right area is the selected technology description, however this is not implemented yet.  Research isn't fully implemented yet, so let's leave it and click on End Turn on the taskbar." />
  <Page text="If a window pops up with your fleet next to a system, this is the colonization window.  Click on a bright planet then click on Colonize button.  Note that there are no people here, you will need to transfer them using the transfer population button mentioned earlier." />
  <Page text="On second turn, with the new ship built, you see the next turn button may be disabled.  If your income is negative, and you don't have enough reserves to pay for everything, you must first balance your budget before being able to continue.  You could scrap ships to reduce maintenance, however that is not implemented yet.  The only way currently is to increase the commerce output of your planets." />
  <Page text="Now let's take a look at what we have so far on space combat.  Click on Game Menu, the leftmost button in taskbar, then New Game.  Now click on the Battle Simulator.  A window pops up, this is the list of available simulations.  There are only one right now, select beam test.xml, then click on Commence Battle." />
  <Page text="Here you see two ships.  The controls are not fully implemented, so please bear that in mind.  You can select either ship, and when a ship is selected, you can see a list of passive equipment on left, and list of weapons and specials on right.  Both ships only have a laser cannon.  Select the laser cannon, and click on a point in the combat area to witness a test firing of the laser, and possibly the shield of the other ship.  This concludes the tutorial." />
